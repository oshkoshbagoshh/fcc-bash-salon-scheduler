This schema consists of three tables: `customers`, `services`, and `appointments`.

* The `customers` table has three columns: `customer_id` (primary key, serial), `name` (varchar(50)), and `phone` (varchar(20), unique).
* The `services` table has two columns: `service_id` (primary key, serial) and `name` (varchar(50)).
* The `appointments` table has four columns: `appointment_id` (primary key, serial), `customer_id` (integer, foreign key references `customers(customer_id)`), `service_id` (integer, foreign key references `services(service_id)`), and `time` (varchar(10)).

The relationships between the tables are as follows:

* A customer can have multiple appointments (one-to-many).
* A service can be booked by multiple customers (one-to-many).
* An appointment is associated with one customer and one service (many-to-one).
